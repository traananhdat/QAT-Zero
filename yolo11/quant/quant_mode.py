# Our code supports three modes of model quantization. They are:
# - ExactModel: Do not quantize the model.
# - SymQuantizeModel: Use LSQ to quantize the model. This is controlled by `SymQuantizeOption` class.
#                     See its definition for more instructions.
# - AsymQuantizeOption: Use LSQ+ to quantize the model. This is controlled by `AsymQuantizeOption` class.
#                     See its definition for more instructions.
